### Instructions:

3. Add the following elements to your web page:
    - A main heading (`<h1>`) with your name.
    - A subheading (`<h2>`) stating your favorite hobby.
    - A paragraph (`<p>`) describing why you like that hobby.
    - An ordered list (`<ol>`) of three things you'd like to learn in this course.
    - An anchor (`<a>`) linking to your favorite website.
4. Save your pen and share the link with the class!

**Bonus**: Try adding an image to your page using the `<img>` tag! Remember to set the `src` attribute to the image's URL.
